Get control of the WordPress wysiwyg visual editor and add some functionality with more buttons and custom TinyMCE plugins.

== Description ==

WP Super Edit is designed to get control of the WordPress wysiwyg visual editor and add some functionality with more buttons and customized TinyMCE plugins. WP Super edit acts as framework for TinyMCE visual editor plugins and buttons allowing administrators (or users) to arrange buttons and add TinyMCE plugins to the visual editor.

**Features**

* Drag and Drop interface for arranging the WordPress visual editor buttons.
* Access to built-in WordPress visual editor buttons and functions. 
* Customized TinyMCE plugins to add additional buttons and features like tables, layers (div tag), advanced XHTML properties, advanced image and link properties, WordPress emoticons, style attributes, css classes for themes, search / replace, and more.
* Options for allowing users to configure visual editor settings; One editor setting for all users, role based editor settings, and individual user editor settings. **Only WordPress administrators can activate or deactivate TinyMCE wysiwyg visual editor plugins. In single or role based modes, only administrators can arrange editor buttons.**
* Easy to install and remove. WP Super Edit uses separate database tables for its settings. Currently only the **Super Emoticon / Icon Plugin** will leave short tags in your posts or pages.

== Installation ==

1. Take the whole whole **wp-super-edit** folder and put it in the **WordPress Plugin** directory for your Web site. 
2. Activate the plugin on the Wordpress Plugins administration panel
3. Click on the Settings option and you will see WP Super Edit in the sub menu.
4. WP Super Edit should lead you through the final installation steps. **Please be patient!** WP Super Edit will attempt to scan and save your original wysiwyg visual editor settings while installing. WP Super Edit will not work until the installation has been completed!

**Upgrade**

**Versions 1.5 or earlier:**

Before you install WP Super Edit, you should deactivate the old version of WP Super Edit and remove the superedit folder from WordPress Plugin folder for your WordPress installation. Follow the installation instructions for the updated version. The updated version should use the wp-super-edit folder in the WordPress Plugin folder and be more compatible and easier to update in the future. Due to the changes in the WordPress editor your old settings will not be updated for the new version of WP Super Edit.
