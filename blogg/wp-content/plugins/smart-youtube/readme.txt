Smart Youtube plugin allows you to insert full featured YouTube videos into your post, comments and in RSS feed. 


== Description ==

Smart Youtube is a Wordpress Youtube Plugin that allows you to easily insert Youtube videos in your post, comments and in RSS feed. 

The main purpose of the plugin is to correctly embed youtube videos into your blog post. The video will be shown in full in your RSS feed as well.

From version 2.0 Smart youtube also supports playback of high quality videos, works on iPhone, produces xHTML valid code (unlike YouTUbe embed code)  and allows you to view videos in fullscreen.

The plugin is designed to be small and fast and not use any external resources. It has a number of customizable options.

Main Features:

* Easily embeds YouTube videos
* Supports latest high quality video protocols (360p and HD quality 720p)
* Allows full YouTube customization (colors, border, full screen...)
* Supports video deep linking (starting at desired point with &start=time parameter)
* Works on iPod and iPhone
* Provides a sidebar widget for videos as well
* Produces xHTML valid code
* Very fast and light, no extra scripts needed


Change Log:

v2.7
- Added support for sidebar widget videos

v2.6:
- Added option to disable search box

v2.5:
- Support for 720p HD (DVD quality) YouTube videos. Use httpvhd://

v2.4:
- Supports video deep linking. Just add &start=time parameter at the end of url. For example httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWfksMD4PAg&start=30 will start the video 30 seconds in

v2.3:
- xHTML valid code is now an option because it breaks videos in some browsers and feeds

v2.2:
- Full xHTML validation

== Credits ==

Some of the functions of SmartYoutube plugin came from other plugins. So I can at least thank these people:

* [Oliver](http://www.deliciousdays.com/ "Oliver") for his [cforms II](http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-plugin "cforms II") plugin
* [Scott](http://www.plaintxt.org/ "Scott") for his excellent readme.txt file
* [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube") folks for their service and javascript selector

Thanks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.
3. Use the Options page to change your options
4. When you want to display Youtube video in your post, copy the video URL to your post and change http:// to httpv:// (notice the 'v' character)

The video will be automatically embedded to your post in the proper way.

Example: httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWfksMD4PAg

If you want to post a high quality video (check if the video exists first!) you would use httpvh:// ('vh' for video high)
If you want to post a HD (DVD quality, 720p) quality video you would use httpvhd:// ('vhd' for video high definition)

Additionally, you can set how do you want the video to be displayed in your RSS feed. Smart Youtube can show the preview image of the video (automatically grabbed from Youtube), the link to the video, or both. I recommend enabling only the preview image.
